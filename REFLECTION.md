# Front-End-Ass

REFLECTION:

Is the first time for me to use a framework as Vue.js, at the beginning it was really strange to use but then I immediately recognize that it was really similar to React.
It was really a nice challenge for me, with a lot of logic staff, but I really enjoyed too!
I think that I did a good job at the end.
